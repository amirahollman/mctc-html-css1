    <div id="tribute-info"> Henrietta Lacks mother of 5, was born August 1st, 1920 in Roanoke Virginia. She worked at a tobacco farm from an early age, and atteded the local school for black children ue to segregation. She went on to marry and have 5 children. In 1951 she noticed a mass in her womb, and was later diagnosed with cervical cancer, it was later discovered she had a different form of cancer, though the treatment would be the same. During her initial treatment two samples were taken from her cervix <u> without her knowledge or consent.</u> One of these samples became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, which is still used to day in biomedical research! She passed in the same year at the age of 31. Due to the cells taken from her labs have been able to rapidly reproduce cells and has led to medical breakthroughs like; the polio vaccine, research in AIDS, cancer, and gene mapping and so many others! Henrietta's cells were shipped out to scientist all over the world and used on over 11,000 patients. There are so many medical and scientific advancements because of her! Though her story has afforded humanity many breakthroughs, it is a story of sadness, greed, and theft. So much money was made off her genetic property, while the family knew nothing about it. Long after her passing an author writing on the subject informed the family. The lacks estate then sued Thermo Fisher Scientific for the net profits. Thermo then settled for an undisclosed amount.
